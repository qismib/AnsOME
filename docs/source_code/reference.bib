  abstract    = {Let the least value of the function F(x), x ∈ Rn, be required, where n ≥ 2. If the gradient ∇F is available, then one can tell whether search directions are downhill, and first order conditions help to identify the solution. It seems in practice, however, that the vast majority of unconstrained calculations do not employ any derivatives. A view of this situation is given, attention being restricted to methods that are suitable for noisy functions, and that change the variables in ways that are not random. Particular topics include the McKinnon (1998) example of failure of the Nelder and Mead (1965) simplex method, some convergence properties of pattern search algorithms, and my own recent research on using quadratic models of the objective function. We find that least values of functions of more than 100 variables can be calculated.},

              As the year-to-year gains in speeds of classical computers continue to taper off, computational chemists are increasingly examining quantum computing as a possible route to achieve greater computational performance. Quantum computers, built upon the properties of superposition, interference, and entanglement of quantum bits, offer, in principle, the possibility to outperform classical computers for solving many important classes of problems. In the field of chemistry, quantum algorithm development offers promising propositions for solving classically intractable problems in areas such as electronic structure, chemical quantum dynamics, spectroscopy, and cheminformatics. However, physical implementations of quantum computers are still in their infancy and have yet to outperform classical computers for useful computations. Still, quantum software development for chemistry is a highly active area of research. In this perspective, we summarize recent progress in the areas of quantum computing algorithms, hardware, and software, and we describe the challenges that remain for useful implementations of quantum computing for chemical applications.},

As a next step along the development of this technology, it is now important to discuss `practical quantum advantage', the point at which quantum devices will solve problems of practical interest that are not tractable for traditional supercomputers. Many of the most promising short-term applications of quantum computers fall under the umbrella of quantum simulation: modelling the quantum properties of microscopic particles that are directly relevant to modern materials science, high-energy physics and quantum chemistry. This would impact several important real-world applications, such as developing materials for batteries, industrial catalysis or nitrogen fixing. Much as aerodynamics can be studied either through simulations on a digital computer or in a wind tunnel, quantum simulation can be performed not only on future fault-tolerant digital quantum computers but also already today through special-purpose analogue quantum simulators. Here we overview the state of the art and future perspectives for quantum simulation, arguing that a first practical quantum advantage already exists in the case of specialized applications of analogue devices, and that fully digital devices open a full range of applications but require further development of fault-tolerant hardware. Hybrid digital--analogue devices that exist today already promise substantial flexibility in near-term applications.},

  abstract = {Our work addresses the question of compelling killer applications for quantum computers. Although quantum chemistry is a strong candidate, the lack of details of how quantum computers can be used for specific applications makes it difficult to assess whether they will be able to deliver on the promises. Here, we show how quantum computers can be used to elucidate the reaction mechanism for biological nitrogen fixation in nitrogenase, by augmenting classical calculation of reaction mechanisms with reliable estimates for relative and activation energies that are beyond the reach of traditional methods. We also show that, taking into account overheads of quantum error correction and gate synthesis, a modular architecture for parallel quantum computers can perform such calculations with components of reasonable complexity. With rapid recent advances in quantum technology, we are close to the threshold of quantum devices whose computational powers can exceed those of classical supercomputers. Here, we show that a quantum computer can be used to elucidate reaction mechanisms in complex chemical systems, using the open problem of biological nitrogen fixation in nitrogenase as an example. We discuss how quantum computers can augment classical computer simulations used to probe these reaction mechanisms, to significantly increase their accuracy and enable hitherto intractable simulations. Our resource estimates show that, even when taking into account the substantial overhead of quantum error correction, and the need to compile into discrete gate sets, the necessary computations can be performed in reasonable time on small quantum computers. Our results demonstrate that quantum computers will be able to tackle important problems in chemistry without requiring exorbitant resources.},

  abstract = {{Coupled cluster theory with single and double excitations accurately describes weak electron correlation but is known to fail in cases of strong static correlation. Fascinatingly, however, pair coupled cluster doubles (p-CCD), a simplified version of the theory limited to pair excitations that preserve the seniority of the reference determinant (i.e., the number of unpaired electrons), has mean field computational cost and is an excellent approximation to the full configuration interaction (FCI) of the paired space provided that the orbital basis defining the pairing scheme is adequately optimized. In previous work, we have shown that optimization of the pairing scheme in the seniority zero FCI leads to a very accurate description of static correlation. The same conclusion extends to p-CCD if the orbitals are optimized to make the p-CCD energy stationary. We here demonstrate these results with numerous examples. We also explore the contributions of different seniority sectors to the coupled cluster doubles (CCD) correlation energy using different orbital bases. We consider both Hartree-Fock and Brueckner orbitals, and the role of orbital localization. We show how one can pair the orbitals so that the role of the Brueckner orbitals at the CCD level is retained at the p-CCD level. Moreover, we explore ways of extending CCD to accurately describe strongly correlated systems.}},

abstract = {Python-based simulations of chemistry framework (PySCF) is a general-purpose electronic structure platform designed from the ground up to emphasize code simplicity, so as to facilitate new method development and enable flexible computational workflows. The package provides a wide range of tools to support simulations of finite-size systems, extended systems with periodic boundary conditions, low-dimensional periodic systems, and custom Hamiltonians, using mean-field and post-mean-field methods with standard Gaussian basis functions. To ensure ease of extensibility, PySCF uses the Python language to implement almost all of its features, while computationally critical paths are implemented with heavily optimized C routines. Using this combined Python/C implementation, the package is as efficient as the best existing C or Fortran-based quantum chemistry programs. In this paper, we document the capabilities and design philosophy of the current version of the PySCF package.
